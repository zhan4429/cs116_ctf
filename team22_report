<h3 id="gobuster-find-hidden-files-and-web-directories">Gobuster: Find
hidden files and web directories</h3>
<p>Gobuster helped us solve several challenges by finding hidden files
and directories that we couldn’t see just by browsing the site. Before
we explain how we solved each challenge, we’ll first show Gobuster
outputs. These gave us clues like secret admin pages, robots.txt, .git,
and cs40 homeworks that led us to the flags.</p>

<h3 id="method-6">Method</h3>
<p>During our scan with WPSscan, several subpages revealed.</p>
<pre><code>wpscan --url http://3.145.206.165</code></pre>
<p>One interesting directory we found was:</p>
<pre><code>http://3.145.206.165/wp-content/uploads/</code></pre>
<p>Inside, there are three folders named: 2022, 2024, and 2025. Under
<code>2024/03</code>, we discovered CS40 homeworks:</p>
<p><img src="cs40_homework.png" alt="cs40 homework" width="60%"></p>
<p>While searching through these files for a flag, we found one named
hello.docx. At first, we tried to open it in Microsoft Word, but it
didn’t render properly. So we checked the file type using
<code>file</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ file hello.docx
hello.docx: PDF document, version 1.7, 1 pages</code></pre>
<p>It identified the file as a PDF rather than a Word document. After
renaming it to hello.pdf, we opened it and successfully found the flag
inside the PDF.</p>

<p>Inspected the board.php page and found there was a code snippet in
the first comment. Compared to all the other comments, it looked
strangely out of place… so doing what a curious person should do: we dug
deeper to figure out what exactly it did. After some digging, we
concluded it was used to log user keystrokes!</p>
<p>After understanding that, we tested going to
http://3.145.206.165/logger.php, since that’s where it looked like
everything was being directed to. To our surprise, we were met with a
blank page didn’t find anything noteable until inspecting the page…
information on JohnHoder’s Javascript Keylogger GitHub.</p>
<p>After finding the GitHub, we saw some information on how the logger
worked and where it was sesnding information to be stored. But to where?
Process of elimination… If it’s not the .js or data.php file, it’s
probably the data.txt file right?</p>
<p>Lo and behold - after plugging in http://3.145.206.165/data.txt, the
key was listed there (along with a lot of other information input which
we assume is from users submitting information to the board.php
page.)</p>
<p>A fun goose chase to go from one point to another!</p>

<h4 id="wireshark">Wireshark</h4>
<p>I followed the UDP stream, and got the text in ASCII format:</p>

<p>From the text, we can see that there are two strings,
<code>lol</code> and <code>wtflol</code>. So I tried to replace
<code>lol</code> with 0 and <code>wtflol</code> with 1 or
<code>lol</code> with 1 and <code>wftlol</code> with 0.</p>
<p>With the binary data, I converted it into ASCII text. It turns out
lol<code>with 0 and</code>wtflol` with 1 makes senses.</p>
<p>Here is the binary data by replacing <code>lol</code> with 0 and
<code>wtflol</code> with 1:</p>
<pre><code>01100010 01110101 01110010 01101001 01100101 01100100 00100000 01101001

<p>I thought we got the key, but the result is disappointing, because
the decoded text is <code>buried in the haystack.</code></p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Out of 15 flags (including the free flag), we captured 11 of the
available flags.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, we were unable to capture any of the 400 point flags.
We feel like we were close on some of them (like LOLCAP and All Your
Base64 belong to us), but weren’t able to find the flags.</li>
<li>We all collaborated together to find the easier flags, and split up
to take on the more challenging ones. We worked together on deciphering
the clues and to tackle some of struggles we encountered.</li>
<li>GoBuster and WordPress Scan were extremely valuable tools in helping
to solve some of the challenges.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>While the challenges seemed difficult, most of the challenges we
solved were just extensions of what we had learned in class and required
some out-of-the-box thinking.</li>
<li>There are many public tools available that are helpful for scraping
and detecting vulnerabilities (Cyberchef, Gobuster, etc.)</li>
<li>It’s very difficult to be completely invulnerable… This lab is setup
to have varying levels of vulnerabilities, but as we learned from the
examples discussed about in class, schools, corporations, and even
encryption companies have had vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>ALWAYS VALIDATE USER PROVIDED INPUT.</li>
<li>Exploring the vulnebilities in this website helped us understand how
simple design flaws can lead to serious security risks. Attackers can
take over the server so easy, such as the message board.</li>
<li>(Joel) Inspecting the elements of a webpage has TONS of information
- super cool to actually dig in to and see what lies underneath the
hood!</li>
<li>(Yucheng)
<ul>
<li>Collaboration is important in solving ctf challenges and working in
cybersecurity. Each memeber of our team comes from different background
and have different set of skills. Looking at the challenges from
different angles help us figure out solution much more efficient.</li>
<li>(Chris) Using common file names that are easily guessable can be a
vulnerability. But boy does it feel good to find a vulnerability!</li>
<li>For quite a few flags, if we locate the hidden pages, the flags are
revealed. Hiding pages does not mean they are secure, we have to make
sure they are not exposed to attackers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Joel) While we didn’t get any of the 400 point flags, they all were
“fair” - nothing out of the ordinary but it either took some extra steps
or a modified approach to get it right. In my opinion, it feels like
some of it just comes from practice and seeing more and more examples -
being able to identify what the problem is and come up with different
approaches that could break it.</li>
<li>(Yucheng) Playing CTF challanges is a very efficient approach to
improve our cybersecurity skills. Security vulnerabilites can exist in
unexpected places. We have to pay attention to details. Weak password is
a serious security risk.</li>
<li>(Chris) Definitely had a blast testing out the skills we’ve learned
in class a very interactive way to learn from classmates and hone our
skills. Strong passwords are definitely a must who knows what that admin
password was.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-would-you-do-differently-for-next-time">What Would You Do
Differently For Next Time?</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Joel) I definitely would search for more available tools! Yucheng
introduced me to Gobuster to find the available files, so I’m curious to
know what other tools there are. I also spent of lot of unnecessary time
by overcomplicating things, when in reality they were a lot simpler
(like decrypting multiple times in a row). For the future, I’d probably
go with my gut instinct to try simple things first before making it more
complicated. More of a personal thing: I also would love to be able to
do this in person! While online is great for remote students, I’d love
to be able to work in-person with folks tackling the same problems. I
think it changes the dynamic and makes it more fun and
collaborative.</li>
<li>(Yucheng) I learnt that playing ctf and working in cybersecurity
require us to have a broad range of skills. We need to understand how
website, network, and database work. In our team, we realized none of us
had strong knowledge in areas such as javascript, sql and web
development. This might be the reason why we were not able to solve the
400-point challenges. We will improve our knowledge and skills in these
fields. I also found that even if I learnt wireshark and burpsuite from
class, my skills are not enough for me to solve real-world challenges.
This requires me to have a deeper understanding and more hands-on
practice.</li>
<li>(Chris) CTF games are very involved and there are so many tools to
help find vulnerabilities. For the most part I think the more experience
you have the better you are at finding the vulnerabilities. So I would
definitely like to learn more ways to find vulnerabilities or interpret
vulnerabilities in JavaScript code.</li>
<li>(Jackson) Through the ctf game, which reinforced many of the same
concepts and tools we learnt in class, I came to appreciate that
identifying/protecting against/exploiting cybersecurity issues require a
very particular lense and familiarity with very particular concepts that
take a lot of practice. And it’s sometimes more efficient to first know
and familiarize yourself with the issues and tricks before starting to
solve the challenges, as opposed to sitting in front of the computer and
just try to spin wheels. I would definitely go through the tricks and
tools we learnt from class one more time if I could do this again before
starting to work on the problems.</li>
</ul>
